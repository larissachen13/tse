# Output from bagtest.c
# Tests the basic insert and extract functions, assuring it operates
# like a stack because of the way I implemeneted insert and extract.
# Assures it works with different types as the data (strings, and ints)
# Assures that items with the same data can be inserted (three, three)
# Tries creating a new bag with a NULL delete function and it doesn't
# work. Also tests the delete function. 
Insert and Extract strings [one, two, three, three] into and out of bag
Extracted String: Three
Extracted String: Three
Extracted String: Two
Extracted String: One
Can't extract more bag is empty

Now adding and extracting integers [1, 2] into the empty bag
Extracted int: 2
Extracted int: 1
Can't extract more bag is empty
Delete function cannot be NULL
