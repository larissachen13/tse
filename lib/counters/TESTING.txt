# Adds key 1 once, key 2 twice, and key 3 thrice. Checks the counter
# for each to assure the add and counter functionality are
# working correctly. Also tests that only positive or zero
# keys are allowed to be insert. Make sure that counters_add
# ignores any NULL key. Also assures the delete_counters is
# freeing up all memory.
