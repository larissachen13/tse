# Querier
### Usage:
  `querier.c` is a standalone program that reads the index file produced by the
  TSE indexer, and answers search queries submitted via stdin.

### compiling: `make`
### usage: `./querier pageDirectory indexFilename`
### where:
  * pageDirectory is a directory produced by the crawler, and
  * indexFilename is the name of a file into where the index is written
  * documents from the pageDirectory has..
    * a unique document ID which starts at 1 and increments for each new document,
    * a filename of form pageDirectory/id,
    * a first line representing the URL,
    * a second line of the depth,
    * its remaining lines representing the pages content
  * the indexfile follows the appropriate format indicated by the `indexer` module
  * the stdin provides the queries

### output:
  printed summary of the query results in the format:
  * header - displays number of documents matched: `Matched: # documents`
  * list of satisfied documents in decreasing rank of score
  * each doc summary displays score, docid, url: `score  39 doc   6: http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/Resources/`

  score is calculated by adding one for any doc that satifies a certain andsequence
  and by adding one for any doc that satifies any element in an or sequence

  if no documents satisfy, header will indicate no documents matched

### Example Command Lines


## Exit Status
* 1- Invalid arguments

## Assumptions
  * pageDirectory is created from the crawler program
  * files in the pageDirectory are formatted according to the crawler program
    standards
  * no gaps exist in the document ids
  * instances of words can only be positive

## Limitations
  * content will not be parsed correctly if it isnt in the correct html format



# Indextest
## Usage:
  `indextest.c` is a testing program for `indexer.c` It loads the index from the
  new file outputted by `indexer` and resaves it to another new file. Output
  from commands `indextest` and `indexer` should be identical.

### compiling: `make`
### usage: `indexetest oldIndexFilename newIndexFilename`
### where:
  * oldIndexFilename is the name of a file produced by the indexer, and
  * newIndexFilename is the name of a file into which the index should be written.

### output:
  new file holding the resaved word to document index where:
  * format matches the format specifications for indexer.c

### Example Command Lines


## Exit Status
 * 1- Invalid arguments

## Assumptions
The querier may assume that the input directory and files follow the designated formats.

pageDirectory has files named 1, 2, 3, â€¦, without gaps.
The content of document files in pageDirectory follow the format as defined in the crawler specs; thus your code (to read a document file) need not have extensive error checking.
The content of the file named by indexFilename follows our Index file format; thus your code (to recreate an index structure by reading a file) need not have extensive error checking.


### ../common/index.c
* holds shared functions such as `index_load` and `index_save`
* also holds functions pertinent to deleting the index_t structure and iterating
  through it

## Exit Status
* 1: Invalid arguments
* 2: Bad Query
